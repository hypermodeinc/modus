# Hypermode AssemblyScript Library

This library is used by Hypermode plugins written in AssemblyScript.
It provides access to host functions of the Hypermode platform,
as well as additional AssemblyScript classes and helper functions
for use with Hypermode plugins.

# Usage

The library itself is packaged as code, not as a compiled WASM module,
thus it does not need to be compiled.

During initial development, we'll reference this library locally.
Later, we'll publish it to NPM.

TODO: Installation instructions.

# Testing

TBD.  Likely [as-pect](https://as-pect.gitbook.io/as-pect/).
