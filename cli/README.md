# Modus CLI

Modus is an open-source, serverless framework for building intelligent functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly.

This package contains the Modus CLI, which is responsible for the Modus local developer experience.

## Getting Started

## Contributing

```bash
npm i
npm run watch
```

You can make changes and run `./bin/modus.js` in a terminal to test changes.

Alternatively, you can set breakpoints and use the VS Code debug target `Debug Modus CLI` to launch the terminal to debug issues.
