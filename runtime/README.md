# Modus Runtime

This directory contains the source code for the Modus Runtime,
which is responsible for loading and executing your Modus application.

Unless you are contributing to the Modus project, you will not need to download this code directly.
Instead, a compiled platform-specific binary of the Modus Runtime will be downloaded and installed
in your development environment by the Modus CLI, or used when hosting a Modus app in production.
