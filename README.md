**Modus is an open-source, serverless framework for building intelligent functions and APIs, powered by WebAssembly.**

This repository contains the Modus source code, including the Modus runtime, SDKs, CLI, and introductory examples.

> ❕ Note: prior to version 0.13, Modus was simply referred to as "Hypermode". Please bear with us if you find name conflicts while we are in transition!

## Getting Started

To get started using Modus, please refer to [the Modus docs](https://docs.hypermode.com/modus) site.

## Open Source

Modus is developed by [Hypermode](https://hypermode.com/) as an open-source project, integral but independent from Hypermode.
We welcome external contributions. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file if you would like to get involved.

## Programming Languages

Since Modus is based on WebAssembly, you can write Modus apps in various programming languages.
Each language offers the full capabilities of the Modus framework.

Currently, the supported languages you may choose from are:

- [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/) - A TypeScript-like language designed for WebAssembly.
  - If you are primarily used to writing front-end web apps, you'll feel at home with AssemblyScript.

- [Go](https://go.dev/) - A general-purpose programming language originally designed by Google.
  - If you are primarily used to writing back-end apps, you'll likely prefer to use Go.

Additional programming languages may be supported in the future.

## Hosting

We have designed Hypermode to be the best place to run your Modus app.
Hypermode hosting plans include features you might expect, such as professional support, telemetry, and high availability.
They also include specialty features such as model hosting that are purposefully designed to work in tandem with Modus apps.

Thus, for the best experience, please consider hosting your Modus apps on Hypermode. See [hypermode.com](https://hypermode.com/) for details and pricing.

As Modus is a free, open-source framework, you’re welcome to run your Modus apps on your own hardware or on any
hosting platform that meets your needs. However, please understand that we cannot directly support issues related
to third-party hosting.

## Support

Hypermode paid hosting plans include standard or premium support that covers both Hypermode and Modus, with response-time guarantees.
Click the _support_ link after signing in to Hypermode, or email help@hypermode.com for paid support if you are a Hypermode customer.

For free community-based support or if you'd just like to share your experiences with
Modus or Hypermode, please chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/NJQ4bJpffF).
We'd be happy to hear from you!
