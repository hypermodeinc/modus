/*
This function demonstrates a more complex HTTP call.
It makes a POST request to the GitHub API to create an issue.

See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-an-issue

To use it, you must add a GitHub personal access token to your secrets.
Create a fine-grained token at https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta with access
to write issues to the repository you want to use, then add it to the appropriate secret
store for your environment.  (See the modus documentation for details.)

NOTE: Do not pass the Authorization header in code when creating the request.
That would be a security risk, as the token could be exposed in the source code repository.

Instead, configure the headers in the modus.json manifest as follows:

	"hosts": {
	  "github": {
	    "baseUrl": "https://api.github.com/",
	    "headers": {
	      "Authorization": "Bearer {{AUTH_TOKEN}}"
	    }
	  }
	}

The Modus runtime will retrieve the token from your secrets and add it to the request.
