# Modus GraphQL Example

This example shows how to call a GraphQL endpoint to execute queries and mutations.

It uses Dgraph at the connection configured in the `modus.json` manifest.

See [./assembly/index.ts](./assembly/index.ts) for the implementation.

You can apply the schema and sample data located in the [./extras/](./extras/) folder
to your Dgraph instance, to run the queries in the example functions.
